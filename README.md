## Description 

This application utilizes the Express and Inquirer npm packages to save and store data, as well as prompt the user to answer simple questions for the data to store or change. MySQL is also used to organize the data into tables. Combining these three techologies provided a wonderful demo on how to store, send, and change data in databases. Starting at the command line, the user can install the necessary npm packages and then run `node app.js`. The user will then be prompted with a series of choices on how to handle the data in the database. See the GIF below for a demo!
